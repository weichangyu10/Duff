abstract = "Variable selection and classification are common objectives in the analysis of high-dimensional data. Most such methods make distributional assumptions that may not be compatible with the diverse families of distributions data can take. A novel Bayesian nonparametric discriminant analysis model that performs both variable selection and classification within a seamless framework is proposed. Polya tree priors are assigned to the unknown group-conditional distributions to account for their uncertainty, and allow prior beliefs about the distributions to be incorporated simply as hyperparameters. The adoption of collapsed variational Bayes inference in combination with a chain of functional approximations led to an algorithm with low computational cost. The resultant decision rules carry heuristic interpretations and are related to an existing two-sample Bayesian nonparametric hypothesis test. By an application to some simulated and publicly available real datasets, the proposed method exhibits good performance when compared to current state-of-the-art approaches."
